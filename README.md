# Kaggle Dataset - Classify Cats and Dogs (very small training dataset)
 We train with very small dataset 200 images for training set but get a great result (test accuracy of 87%)
 
 + training set 200 images (100 cats/ 100 dogs)
 
 + validation set 100 images (50 cats/ 50 dogs)
 
 + test set 100 images (50 cats/ 50 dogs)

We will create many CNN models to distinguish dogs from cats 

+ basic CNN

+ CNN with Data Augmentation and Dropout

+ Transfer Learning with VGG16 - feature extraction (freeze base model)

+ Transfer Learning with VGG16 - fine tuning (unfreeze few last layers of base model)
